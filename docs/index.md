# Preface {-}

This book aims to learn more about Rmarkdown, bookdown and modeling in R while doing the exercises of the CTLSCx courses. There will be only recitations, lessons and practice problems solutions. So therefore, bear with me if any major issue appears, this is purely designed for learning, even though I hope it might help other students who are passionate about SCM and R.

CTLSCx is a set of 5  (awesome!) courses on Supply Chain Management given by MITx on edx. For more information on the program check in the <edx website> [MITx SCM](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-supply-chain-management)
